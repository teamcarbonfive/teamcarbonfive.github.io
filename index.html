            <p class='heading_paragraph'>Carbon 5 is a team of one year 11 and 4 year 10 students, deriving from Newton Moore Senior High School. Forming mid 2017, we united with the goal of competing in  the WA state finals, hopefully to do well as a new team, and to promote science and achievement in rural schools. We all thoroughly enjoy learning and engaging in science-based activities (as all of us have been in the school’s Engineering Specialist Program), and given this opportunity, we gladly accepted to compete in this competition. Each member, taking upon the role that best suited their personality, interest and ability, was able to establish a well-oiled, functioning team environment. We look forward to the 2018 National Finals, as it will provide us with an incredible and rare experience, by which we can take away so many new skills and memories.

                    <p class='heading_paragraph'>Although being a newly-formed  team, Carbon 5 comprises of students who have  participated in this competition in previous years. Brodie and Jordan, our resource manager and design engineer, competed in the 2016 WA state finals as team Titanite. They did well, coming in 3rd place overall, and taking away valuable experience and knowledge that has helped them to improve from their previous attempt. Bonnie, team manager, was previously a member of team Cosmos, which competed in the 2016 WA state finals, and from here, won the wild card and proceeded to compete in the 2017 Australian National finals; taking away the Encouragement Award. From this, she has a very broad understanding of the competition itself, and from this knowledge has aided to guide Team Carbon 5. Kage and Harry, although new  to the F1 competition, have had previous experience with Subs In schools, and from this have valuable manufacturing knowledge. Our team, having competed in the 2017 WA State Finals, won the 2nd Place, Innovation and Verbal Presentation Awards, which were incredible achievements for our school, given we had not won something like this before.</p>

                    <p class=ph_fit>Bonnie is a supportive and driven leader, whose role was to guide the team and project, overlook, plan and assess all team activities, and from there systemise further continuation. As team manager, she has fulfilled  her role by assisting all team members in most aspects of their roles, has devised ongoing plans leading to the final outcome, and from past experience has guided the team and provided support where necessary. Additionally, she was the main organiser of the portfolio/theme. </p>

                <h3 class='profiles'>Jordan Neill</h3>
                <div class=pfl_photo><img class=pfl_photo src='Photos/IMG_9671.JPG'></div>
                
                    <p class=ph_fit>Jordan is a bright and charismatic student, whose role was  to virtually design an effective and streamline car for our team. As design engineer, his responsibility is to construct a virtual 3D sketch of the team’s car on the CAD computer program. This design includes both the construction of the car body and extra components (eg, wings, wheels etc). From here, he then prepares the car by converting it to an STL file on the program, and transporting it so it can physically be cut out using the CNC router. He also designed components for 3D printing, by which he aided to print out.</p>

                    <p class=ph_fit>Kage is a brainy and innovative member, whose role was to manufacture the physical components of our team’s image, including the car, components, trade display and extra constituents. As manufacturer engineer, Kage managed to fulfil his role by learning to use the CNC router and producing team cars, virtually designed, drafted and built the trade display structure, and has used the laser printer to manufacture branding components. He also established renders of the trade display, using the program Google Sketchup, where his designs were then used in the portfolio/display.</p>

As resource manager, he has successfully fulfilled his role by process of updating our budget status regularly, identifying how money would be spent, and therefore the most efficient way to collect resources required. He was also the main instigator of sponsor and collaborator organisation, by which he contacted said individuals/groups multiple ways and gained assistance for our team.</p>
